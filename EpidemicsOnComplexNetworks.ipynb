    "In 1927, McKendrick and Kermack wrote down a simpler, ordinary differential equation model of epidemics. This eventually became known as the <em>SIR model</em>. In the SIR model, a total population of $N$ individuals is divided into three subpopulations, or compartments. First, there are $S$ individuals who are not yet infected, but are susceptible to infection in the future. Next, there are $I$ individuals who are infected, and can pass on the infection to susceptible individuals. Finally, there are $R$ individuals who were infected, and has recovered (or died). These $R$ individuals can no longer infect others, and cannot be infected a second time.\n",

    "\n",
    "As we can see, this model of epidemics is written in terms of ordinary differential equations, where we assume that $S(t)$, $I(t)$, and $R(t)$ are continuous variables, instead of integers. This is a useful approximation when the total population $N$ is large compared to the changes $\\Delta S(t)$, $\\Delta I(t)$, and $\\Delta R(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the SIR model was written down, more epidemic models were invented. For example, for diseases where infected individuals do not recover (such as in malaria), we omit the $-\\gamma I(t)$ term and $R(t)$ to obtain the SI model. Also, susceptible individuals coming into contact with infected individuals do not become infectious immediately, but only become so after a period of time. We call these individuals <em>exposed</em>, and there are $E(t)$ of them at time $t$. The modifed model is called the SEIR model."

    "In ODE models like the SIR model, we assume that $S(t)$, $I(t)$, and $R(t)$ can change continuously, and that all three types of individuals mixed thoroughly with each other. However, in a real community, we mix only with people we know, or live close to us, while people who live far away will mix only with people they know, or live close to them. More importantly, some people mix only with a few people, because these are all whom they know, whereas others mix with many people. Therefore, the basis for understanding disease transmission should be on a complex network."
